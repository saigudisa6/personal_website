                My programming journey began in 9th grade when I said Hello to the World and... hated it. Yes, I absolutely despised the idea of computer programming
                and wanted to stay as far as I could from it. <i>But</i> as I learned more and more Java and broadened my knowledge of programming as a whole, I knew
                there was nothing I'd rather do. Since then, I've been <b>certified in Java</b>, gained an understanding of <b>Python</b>, and have recently dived into the world of web development with
                <b>React.js</b> and <b>HTML/CSS</b>. I'm brimming with excitement and unwavering passion for the boundless possibilities that coding opens up, and I'm immensely
                grateful for the opportunity to pursue them for the rest of my life.
